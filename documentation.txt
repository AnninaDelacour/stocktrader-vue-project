1) MAIN SETUP

1.1) LAYOUT
In the beginning we will create the layout.
Hence we have to add components to the app. After adding "Home.vue" and "Header.vue" to "Components", we create two folders
within the Component-Folder, and call them "Portfolio" and "Stocks".
Within Portfolio we add a "Portfolio.vue"-File and a "Stock.vue" file.
Within Stocks we add a "Stocks.vue" and a "Stock.vue".
After that we all add a template in each component.

1.2) ROUTES
Up next we create the routes.js-file in the src-folder. We need to import the components and then set up paths for each of them.
But first we run the command "npm install --save vue-router" and import VueRouter in the main.js-file with
"import VueRouter from 'vue-router';" and "Vue.use(VueRouter)".
Next we go into the routes.js-file and import all files we want as routes.
To use them we write:

"export const routes = [
    { path: '', component: },
    ...
];"

After setting up the routes we go back to the main.js-file and import the routes to use them globally. For that we add
"import { routes } from './src/routes'" and following we add below "Vue.use" a:
"const router = new VueRouter({
    mode: 'history',
    router
});".
Before we save we subsequently add to the "new Vue"-Instance before "render" again "router,",
since we named this constant "router" in the code above.
